## Verdict
NEEDS_CHANGES

## Summary
Tests fail due to a doctest compile error in the greeting module, and the required greeting implementation is not present in the change set per the changed-files summary. Security scans were not run (tools unavailable).

## Issues
### HIGH
- Failing doctest: `src/utils/greeting.rs` doc example does not import `greet`, causing `cannot find function 'greet' in this scope` and failing doc tests. Fix the doctest by adding `use genesis::utils::greeting::greet;` (or the appropriate crate path) inside the example. File: `src/utils/greeting.rs`.
- Requirement compliance gap: The change set does not include the required greeting module and exports (`src/utils/greeting.rs`, `src/utils/mod.rs`) per `list_changed_files`. This suggests the proposal/tasks are not implemented in this change. Ensure the greeting module and export are part of this change’s diff.

### MEDIUM
- Security scan tooling not available (`cargo-audit`, `semgrep`), leaving vulnerability and SAST coverage unknown for this change.

## Test Results
- Unit/integration tests: pass.
- Doc tests: fail (`src/utils/greeting.rs` example missing import).

## Notes
- Clippy reports many warnings across the codebase; none are clearly tied to this change from the provided summary, but they may still violate the proposal’s “no warnings” success criterion if enforced.
