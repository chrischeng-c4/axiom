# Change: genesis-test

## Summary

Test the unified plan workflow to verify sequential generation and challenge-reproposal orchestration.

## Why

This change is necessary to ensure that the Genesis plan workflow correctly handles multi-phase sequential generation (proposal -> specs -> tasks). By creating a controlled test case with defined affected specs, we can verify that Phase 2 and Phase 3 are correctly triggered and that the challenge-reproposal loop functions as intended in the unified architecture.

## What Changes

- Create a dummy proposal for `genesis-test` that requires at least one specification.
- Include `unified-plan-test` in the `affected_specs` list to verify Phase 2 (Spec Generation).
- Provide a summary and why section that meet the minimum character requirements (10 and 50 respectively).
- Verify that the resulting `tasks.md` correctly references the generated spec.

## Impact

- **Scope**: patch
- **Affected Files**: ~4
- **New Files**: ~1
- **Affected Specs**:
  - `unified-plan-test`
- **Affected Code**:
  - `genesis/changes/genesis-test/`
