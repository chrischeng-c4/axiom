# Specification: Plan Viewer UI

## Overview

The Plan Viewer is a standalone native window that renders `genesis` plan files in a human-friendly format. It aims to provide a high-fidelity preview of technical designs, including rendered diagrams and interactive elements for review.

## Requirements

### R1: Native Window Rendering
The viewer must open as a native desktop window (not just a browser tab) using the `wry` library. It must be feature-gated (e.g., `feature = "ui"`) to avoid bloat in minimal builds.

### R2: Multi-file Support
The viewer must be able to display and switch between `proposal.md`, `CHALLENGE.md`, and `STATE.yaml`.
- Markdown files must be rendered to HTML with syntax highlighting for code blocks (using `highlight.js` or similar).
- YAML files (`STATE.yaml`) must be rendered as syntax-highlighted text (e.g., wrapped in a `<pre><code class="language-yaml">` block for `highlight.js` to process).
- When a file is loaded, the backend must also fetch any associated annotations and send them to the frontend.
- If a requested file (e.g., `CHALLENGE.md`) does not exist, the backend must return a rendered HTML placeholder (e.g., "File not found") instead of crashing or returning an error.

### R3: Mermaid Rendering
Mermaid diagrams defined in Markdown code blocks must be rendered as SVG diagrams within the content area. Mermaid assets must be bundled into the binary (e.g., using `include_dir`) and served via a custom protocol (e.g., `genesis://`) to support completely offline usage.

### R4: Markdown Fidelity
Markdown content should be rendered with proper headings, lists, tables, and code highlighting.
- Must enable GFM extensions: tables, strikethrough, task lists.
- Must inject stable, deterministic ID slugs for all headings to support annotation targeting. (Injection occurs in the backend during rendering).

### R5: Responsive Navigation
A navigation component (sidebar or tabs) must allow the user to switch between tracked files within the active change.

### R6: Process Isolation & Fallback
The viewer must run on the main thread to satisfy `tao` requirements on macOS.
- The `genesis` binary entry point (`main.rs`) must be refactored to conditionally run the viewer on the main thread *before* initializing any async runtime.
- When triggered from `genesis proposal`, it should spawn as a **detached child process** so the CLI can exit or continue independently.
- **Fallback**: If the `ui` feature is disabled, the auto-open logic in `genesis proposal` must NOT attempt to spawn a process. Instead, it must log the exact message: "UI feature disabled. View plan manually at: [path]"

### R7: Error Handling
The viewer must handle invalid inputs gracefully.
- The CLI command must validate `change_id` before opening the window. If the change directory does not exist, it must print "Change '[change_id]' not found" and exit with a non-zero status code.
- Save operations must use atomic writes to prevent data corruption.
- If a save operation fails (e.g., permissions), the backend must return an error response via IPC, and the UI must display a toast/banner notification to the user.

### R8: Review Actions
The viewer must provide action buttons for completing the review process.
- **Approve Button**: Marks the review as complete, updates `STATE.yaml` phase to `complete`, and closes the viewer.
- **Request Changes Button**: Saves current annotations as review feedback and updates phase to indicate changes needed.
- **Submit Comments Button**: Saves annotations without changing phase, allowing continued review.
- All buttons must be prominently displayed in a toolbar or footer area.
- The backend must handle `complete_review` IPC message to update `STATE.yaml` and optionally trigger next workflow steps.

## Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CLI as Genesis CLI (Parent)
    participant Child as Genesis View Process
    participant VW as Viewer Window (Rust)
    participant Protocol as Custom Protocol Handler
    participant JS as Webview (HTML/JS)
    participant FS as File System

    CLI->>Child: spawn(genesis view change_id)
    Child->>Child: Validate change_id exists
    Child->>VW: Initialize Window on Main Thread
    VW->>JS: Load genesis://index.html
    JS->>Protocol: Request CSS/JS/Mermaid
    Protocol-->>JS: Serve Bundled Assets
    JS->>VW: IPC(load_file, "proposal.md")
    VW->>FS: Read proposal.md & annotations.json
    VW->>VW: Render Markdown & Inject Heading IDs
    alt File Missing
        VW-->>JS: Return { content: "File not found", annotations: [] }
    else File Exists
        VW-->>JS: Return { content: HTML, annotations: [...] }
    end
    JS->>JS: Inject HTML into DOM
    JS->>JS: Render Annotations in Sidebar
    Note over JS: User interacts with UI
```

## Interfaces

```
FUNCTION start_viewer(change_id: String, project_root: Path) -> Result<()>
  INPUT: change_id of the plan to view, project_root for file access
  OUTPUT: Blocks the main thread until window is closed
  SIDE_EFFECTS: Opens a native window, claims main thread, registers custom protocol
  ERRORS: ChangeNotFound (handled before call), InvalidPath

FUNCTION render_plan_to_html(file_path: Path) -> String
  INPUT: Path to a markdown or yaml file
  OUTPUT: HTML string with embedded CSS and layout
  ERRORS: FileNotFound (returns placeholder HTML), ParseError
  NOTE: Must inject id="..." attributes into headings during rendering

FUNCTION handle_ipc_message(message: JsonValue) -> JsonValue
  INPUT: JSON message from the webview
  OUTPUT: JSON response or action (like saving a file)
  SIDE_EFFECTS: May update local files (atomic write) or window state
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: WHEN user opens valid change THEN viewer displays files
- **WHEN** user runs `genesis view my-change`
- **THEN** a native window opens with a sidebar listing `proposal.md`, `CHALLENGE.md`, and `STATE.yaml`

### Scenario: WHEN user opens invalid change THEN error is shown
- **WHEN** user runs `genesis view non-existent-change`
- **THEN** the command exits with message "Change 'non-existent-change' not found" and status code 1, and does not open a window

### Scenario: WHEN UI feature disabled THEN fallback message is logged
- **WHEN** `genesis proposal` completes and updates phase to `CHALLENGED` (with `ui` feature disabled)
- **THEN** a message "UI feature disabled. View plan manually at: [path]" is logged, and no process is spawned

### Scenario: WHEN file is missing THEN placeholder is shown
- **WHEN** user clicks `CHALLENGE.md` but the file does not exist
- **THEN** the viewer displays a "File not found" placeholder instead of crashing

### Scenario: WHEN annotation save fails THEN error notification appears
- **WHEN** user attempts to save an annotation but the file system is read-only
- **THEN** the UI displays an error notification

### Scenario: WHEN user approves review THEN phase is updated
- **WHEN** user clicks the "Approve" button after reviewing the plan
- **THEN** `STATE.yaml` phase is updated to `complete`, a success message is shown, and the viewer closes

### Scenario: WHEN user requests changes THEN annotations are saved
- **WHEN** user clicks the "Request Changes" button with annotations added
- **THEN** annotations are saved, `STATE.yaml` phase remains unchanged (or set to needs-revision), and the viewer closes with a summary

### Scenario: WHEN user submits comments THEN viewer stays open
- **WHEN** user clicks "Submit Comments" button
- **THEN** annotations are saved but the viewer remains open for continued review
